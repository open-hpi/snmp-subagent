    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB defines the HPI instrumentation based on
        'Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface'
        (SA-HPI-B.01.01).

        This MIB module defines a set of objects that allow the 
        management of entities on a variety of hardware platforms.  The  
        abstractions presented in this MIB are derived from the 
        Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface 
        specification version SAI-HPI-B.01.01.
           
        The MIB views a hardware platform as a collection of physical 
                  entities that can be managed individually.  A logical 
                  collection of entities comprises a management domain.

         Each entity has a common set of attributes reflected in the 
         entity table.  Entities may have additional categorical 
                  attributes that may exist in one or more of the hotswap 
                  table, control table, sensor table, watchdog table,
                  inventory control table and config table.

         The hotswap table defines management attributes
         for an entity that supports hotswap, generally referred to as 
                  a FRU.

         The controls table defines variables for reading and setting 
                  controls associated with an entity.

         The sensors table defines variables for reading sensors 
                  associated with an entity as well as controlling event 
                  generation for that sensor.

        The watchdog table defines variables for reading watchdog
                  associated with an entitry.

        The inventory control defines variables for reading inventory
                resources.

SaHpiTime ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
	STATUS       current
	DESCRIPTION
	"This textual convention defines the HPI time value as 
an 64-bit value.

An HPI time value represents the local time as the number of nanoseconds
from 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, in a 64-bit signed integer. This format
is sufficient to represent times with nano-second resolution from the
year 1678 to 2262. Every API which deals with time values must define
the timezone used.
	
It should be noted that although nano-second resolution is supported
in the data type, the actual resolution provided by an implementation
may be more limited than this.
	
The value -2^63, which is 0x8000000000000000, is used to indicate
'unknown/unspecified time'.
	
Conversion to/from POSIX and other common time representations is
relatively straightforward. The following code framgment converts
between SaHpiTimeT and time_t:

	time_t tt1, tt2;
	SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

	time(&tt1);
	saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tt1  1000000000;
	tt2 = saHpiTime / 1000000000;

The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timeval:

	struct timeval tv1, tv2;
	SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

	gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
	saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tv1.tv_sec  1000000000 + tv1.tv_usec  1000;
	tv2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
	tv2.tv_usec = saHpiTime % 1000000000 / 1000;

The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timespec:

	struct timespec ts1, ts2;
	SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

	clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts1);
	saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) ts1.tv_sec  1000000000 + ts1.tv_nsec;
	ts2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
	ts2.tv_nsec = saHpiTime % 1000000000;

Note, however, that since time_t is (effectively) universally 32 bits,
all of these conversions will cease to work on January 18, 2038.

Some subsystems may need the flexibility to report either absolute or
relative (eg. to system boot) times. This will typically be in the
case of a board which may or may not, depending on the system setup,
have an idea of absolute time. For example, some boards may have
'time of day' clocks which start at zero, and never get set to the
time of day.

In these cases, times which represent 'current' time (in events, for
example) can be reported based on the clock value, whether it has been
set to the actual date/time, or whether it represents the elapsed time
since boot. If it is the time since boot, the value will be (for 27
years) less than 0x0C00000000000000, which is Mon May 26 16:58:48 1997.
If the value is greater than this, then it can be assumed to be an
absolute time.

Every API which can report either absolute or relative times must
state this rule clearly in its interface specification.

        Each set of events is uniquely identified with a label which easily refers back to the 
        corresponding category. Only events from the same category should be

        can be used.  Similarly, when setting the event enabled status a set 
        of all applicable event states can be used.
     For example, for the type threshold(2), the retrieved states can
        be:
 
        LOWER_MINOR, UPPER_CRIT, UPPER_MAJOR
        
        When the event category is the unspecified(0) type, the event can be:

SaHpiHotSwapState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines the enumeration of states
    specific to Hot Swap records.

        inactive(1):

        The INACTIVE state indicates that the FRU, which supports the full hot swap model, is no longer active in the system, and that it has completed the extraction process. When a FRU completes the hardware disconnection process, it is logically and electrically disconnected or isolated from the platform but still physically located in the platform, so the associated resource remains in the domain. Typically, a FRU will be powered off or held in reset when in this state. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INACTIVE when the resource is transitioning to an INACTIVE state.

        insertionPending(2):

        The INSERTION PENDING state is entered after a resource that supports the full hot swap model has been added to the domain, as a result of the associated FRU being physically inserted into the system. This state indicates the resource is transitioning from a NOT PRESENT state or INACTIVE state into the ACTIVE state. When transitioning into the INSERTION PENDING state, the resource should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INSERTION_PENDING. The event can be generated when the ejector latch is shut (cPCI) or the device is seated in a slot. 
        Upon receiving the event, the HPI User has the opportunity to discover the capabilities of the resource before allowing the FRU associated with the resource to power on and become an active component in the system. During this state, the FRU can be commanded to power on or de-assert reset.


        active(3):

        The ACTIVE state indicates that a resource is now an active member of the domain.

        After a FRU completes the hardware connection process, the associated resource enters the ACTIVE state. This does not mean that the FRU is now active at the software level, but merely indicates that the FRU is now active in the system and that it should not be abruptly removed. The HPI implementation generates a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_ACTIVE when the resource transitions to the ACTIVE state.

        extractionPending(4):

        The EXTRACTION PENDING state indicates that the resource, which supports the full hot swap model, has requested extraction of the associated FRU. Typically, a resource enters an EXTRACTION PENDING state when an ejector latch is opened (PICMG 2.1) or when a hot swap button is pressed. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_EXTRACTION_PENDING when a resource that supports Managed Hot Swap requests extraction. 
        Upon receiving the event, the HPI User has the opportunity to unload software drivers, relocate processes, or unmount file systems (software disconnect) before allowing a FRU to power down and disconnect from the system.

        notPresent(5):

         The NOT PRESENT state is actually a virtual state that represents a resource that is not currently present in the domain, because the FRU associated with that resource is not currently present in the system. A resource is in this state before the FRU is physically inserted into the system or if it has been removed from the system. A resource that supports the full Hot Swap model typically transitions to this state from the INACTIVE state, but a resource can transition to this state from any state due to a surprise extraction of the FRU. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_NOT_PRESENT when the resource transitions from any state to the NOT PRESENT state.

         The event can indicate a normal transition from INACTIVE to the NOT PRESENT state or a surprise extraction from any other state.  Normal transition events are issued with a severity of SAHPI_INFORMATIONAL. A resource following the simplified hot swap model always indicates the transition to the NOT PRESENT state as a surprise extraction.
         When a resource associated with a FRU fails, many systems will detect this as a NOT PRESENT state for the FRU, and report it as a transition to the NOT PRESENT state (a normal transition if the resource was in the INACTIVE state, or a surprise extraction if it was in a different state).  If the resource is subsequently restored to functionality, these systems will then detect the presence of the FRU, and report another state transition from the NOT PRESENT state to the current hot swap state for the restored resource.  If the current hot swap state is not the normal ~initial~ state for the FRU when it is inserted (i.e., INSERTION PENDING for a resource that uses the full hot swap model or ACTIVE for a resource that uses the simplified hot swap model), then the severity of the ~unusual~ hot swap event showing a transition from NOT PRESENT to a different state should be the severity contained in the ResourceSeverity field in the resource~s RPT entry.

        DESCRIPTION

type of text value. 

        The encoding of the SaHpiText type is defined by this enumeration.
        The following table describes the various encodings:

         UNICODE         16-bit Unicode, least significant byte first.
                         Buffer must contain even number of bytes.
        
         BCDPLUS         8-bit ASCII, '0'-'9' or space, dash, period,
                         colon, comma, or underscore only.
        
         ASCII6          8-bit ASCII, reduced set, 0x20=0x5f only.
        
         TEXT            8-bit ASCII+Latin 1
        
         BINARY          8-bit bytes, any values legal
        
        Note: 'ASCII+Latin 1' is derived from the first 256 characters of 
        Unicode 2.0. The first 256 codes of Unicode follow ISO 646 (ASCII)
        and ISO 8859/1 (Latin 1). The Unicode 'C0 Controls and Basic Latin'
        set defines the first 128 8-bit characters (00h-7Fh) and the 
        'C1 Controls and Latin 1 Supplement' defines the second 128 (80h-FFh).
        
        Note: The BCDPLUS and ASCII6 encodings
        use normal ASCII character encodings, but restrict the allowed
        characters to a subset of the entire ASCII character set. These
        encodings are used when the target device contains restrictions
        on which characters it can store or display.  BCDPLUS 
        data may be stored externally as 4-bit values, and 
        ASCII6 may be stored externally as 6-bit values. 
        But, regardless of how the data is stored externally, it is 
        encoded as 8-bit ASCII in the SaHpiText structure passed 
        across the HPI.

does not have an associated GUID.
 
The format if the ID follows that specified by the Wired for
Management Baseline, Version 2.0 specification.  HPI uses
version 1 of the GUID format, with a 3-bit variant field of 
10x (where x indicates 'don't care')"

	other domains associated with the domain. The two saHpiDomainId 
	indices for this table are used to uniquely a domain and an associated 
	domain, that are in a peer or tiered domain relationship.

	The DRT contains an entry for each associated domain, and HPI MIB Users 
	may read these entries to discover the presence of additional domains within 
	a 'System'. The discovered domains can, in turn, be used to discover additional 
	resources and domains. The DRT is automatically built and maintained by the HPI 
	implementation.  Domain entries in the DRT may change over time if the 'System'
	configuration changes.  

	There are two types of domain references:

	- A peer domain architecture, which consists of two or more domains that are 
	expected to contain the same resources and domain references.  Each domain 
	in a peer relationship contains an RPT listing all resources present in each 
	domain. 

	- A tiered (child) domain architecture is used when all the resources in a 
	'system' cannot be accessed in a single domain.  A 'parent' domain references 
	one or more 'child' domains in its DRT.  The 'child' domains may be simple 
	domains containing only resources, or they may themselves be a 'parent' to 
	other 'child' domains.  Domains in a tiered relationship are disjointed and 
	do not contain the same resources.

	Note:
	When a domain is added to the DRT (SAHPI_DOMAIN_REF_ADDED) and when a domain 
	is removed from the DRT (SAHPI_DOMAIN_REF_REMOVED) an event is generated.

        by the implementation.  Typically, an implementation ignores acknowledged   
        alarms when announcing an alarm on annunciation devices such as audible     
        sirens and dry contact closures.  However, alarm annunciation is            
        implementation-specific.                                                    
                                                                                    
        An acknowledged alarm will have the Acknowledged field in the alarm entry   
        set to True.                                                                
                                                                                    
        DomainAlarms are acknowledged by one of two ways: a single alarm entry by DomainAlarmId 
        regardless of severity or as a group of alarm entries by Severity           
        regardless of DomainAlarmId.                                                      
                                                                                    
        To acknowledge all alarms contained within the DAT, set the Severity        
        parameter to allSeverities(256), and set the DomainAlarmId parameter to         
        SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.                                                    
                                                                                    
        To acknowledge all alarms of a specific severity contained within the DAT,  
        set the Severity parameter to the appropriate value, and set the DomainAlarmId    
        parameter to SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.                                       
                                                                                    
        To acknowledge a single alarm entry, set the DomainAlarmId parameter to a value   
        other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.  The DomainAlarmId must be a valid identifier 
        for an alarm entry present in the DAT at the time of the function call.     
                                                                                    
        If an alarm has been previously acknowledged, acknowledging it again has no 
        effect.  However, this is not an error.                                     
                                                                                    
        If the DomainAlarmId parameter has a value other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED,    
        the Severity parameter is ignored.                                          
                                                                                    
        If the DomainAlarmId parameter is passed as SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED, and no       
        alarms are present that meet the requested Severity, this function will     
        have no effect.  However, this is not an error.                             
                                                                                    
        SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED is defined as the same value as SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY,  
        so using either symbol will have the same effect.  However,                 
        SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED should be used with this function for clarity.

   The status column uses four defined values:

       available for use by the managed device;

    - `notInService(2)', which indicates that the conceptual
    	row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
	the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
	no implication regarding the internal consistency of
	the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
	the current state of the managed device.

    - `createAndWait(5)', which is supplied by a management
      station wishing to create a new instance of a
      conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
      the managed device). This function is used to add a User 
      Alarm to the Domain Alarm Table and User Even Table.
      The row is created (and changes state to 'active' when 
      the saHpiDomainAlarmSeverity has been set on) to a 
      new instance of the conceptual row. The dis-allowed 
      saHpiDomainAlarmSeverity values are minor(3), major(2), and
      critical(3). When a row is created in the DAT it is also
      duplicated in the User Event Table.

    - `destroy(6)', which is supplied by a management station
      wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
      an existing conceptual row. This function allows the 
      HPI MIB User to delete a single User Alarm from the 
      Domain Alarm Table and User Event Table. 
      Only User Alarms added to the DAT and User Event Table 
      can be deleted. To delete a single, specific alarm, set the 
      saHpiDomainAlarmId parameter to a value representing an 
      actual User Alarm in the DAT.

        Resource Capabilities
        
        This definition defines the capabilities of a given resource.
        One resource may support any number of capabilities using this
        string (each capability is seperated by a delimeter). 

        Because each entry in an RPT will have the 
        RESOURCE string, no value  is not a valid value for the 
        capability flag, and is thus used to indicate 'no RPT
        entry present' in some function calls.
        
        RESOURCE
        EVT_DEASSERTS

        Indicates that all sensors on the resource have the property that their
        Assertion and Deassertion event enable flags are the same. That is,
        for all event states whose assertion triggers an event, it is
        guaranteed that the deassertion of that event will also
        trigger an event. 
        
        Thus, an HPI User may track the state of sensors on the
        resource by monitoring events rather than polling for state changes.

        AGGREGATE_STATUS
        CONFIGURATION
        MANAGED_HOTSWAP

        Indicates that the resource supports the full managed hot swap model. 
        Since hot swap only makes sense for field-replaceable units, the 
        FRU capability string must also be set for this columnar object.

        WATCHDOG
        CONTROL
        FRU

        Indicates that the resource is a field-replaceable unit; i.e., it is
        capable of being removed and replaced in a live system. If
        MANAGED_HOTSWAP is also set, the resource supports
        the full hot swap model.  If MANAGED_HOTSWAP is not
        set, the resource supports the simplified hot swap model.

        POWER
        RESET
        INVENTORY_DATA
        EVENT_LOG
        RDR

        Indicates that a resource data record (RDR) repository is supplied
        by the resource. Since the existence of an RDR is mandatory for all
        management instruments, this capability must be asserted if the 
        resource contains any sensors, controls, watchdog timers, or inventory
        data repositories.

	DESCRIPTION
	"This function allows the HPI User to configure a timeout for

	This function accepts a parameter instructing each resource to impose

	to direct resources to proceed immediately to auto-insertion, 
	or to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK to prevent auto-insertion from ever occurring.
	If the parameter is set to another value, then it defines the number 
	of nanoseconds between the time a hot swap event with 
	saHpiHotSwapState == INSERTION_PENDING is generated, and the time 
	that the auto-insertion policy will be invoked for that resource.  
	If, during this time period, a saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel function 
	call is processed, the timer will be stopped, and the auto-insertion 
	policy will not be invoked.  Each domain maintains a single 
	auto-insert timeout value and it is applied to all contained resources 
	upon insertion, which support managed hot swap. Once the auto-insertion 
	process begins, the HPI User will not be allowed to take control of 
	the insertion process; hence, the timeout should be set appropriately 
	to allow for this condition.  Note that the timeout period begins 
	when the hot swap event with saHpiHotSwapState == INSERTION_PENDING 
	is initially generated."

        function call is processed, the timer will be stopped, and the 
        auto-extraction policy will not be invoked. 

        Once the auto-extraction process begins, the HPI User will not be 
        allowed to take control of the extraction process; hence, the 
        timeout should be set appropriately to allow for this condition. 

        Note that the timeout period begins when the hot swap event with 
        saHpiHotSwapState = extractionPending(4) is initially generated.

        DESCRIPTION
        "A resource supporting hot swap typically supports default policies for 
        insertion and extraction. On insertion, the default policy may be for 
        the resource to turn the associated FRU~s local power on and to 
        de-assert reset. On extraction, the default policy may be for the 
        resource to immediately power off the FRU and turn on a hot swap 
        indicator. This function allows an HPI User, after receiving a hot 
        swap event with saHpiHotSwapState equal to INSERTION_PENDING or 
        EXTRACTION_PENDING, to prevent the default policy from being executed.  

        Once the resource transitions to either the ACTIVE or INACTIVE state, 
        the default policies will once again execute, unless cancelled using 
        saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel.

        The default policy cannot be canceled once it has begun to execute.  

        Because a resource that supports the simplified hot swap model will 
        never transition into INSERTION PENDING or EXTRACTION PENDING states, 
        this function is not applicable to those resources.

cycle(3) is a pulsed power operation and is not a valid return for the power state.

This function controls the hardware power on a FRU entity regardless of what hot-swap state the resource is in. For example, it is legal (and may be desirable) to cycle power on the FRU even while it is in ACTIVE state in order to attempt to clear a fault condition. Similarly, a resource could be instructed to power on a FRU even while it is in INACTIVE state, for example, in order to run off-line diagnostics.
Not all resources supporting hot swap will necessarily support this function. In particular, resources that use the simplified hot swap model may not have the ability to control FRU power. 
This function may also be supported for non-FRU entities if power control is available for those entities.

        DESCRIPTION
        "Sensor Events and Sensor Event States:
        Each Event State may be asserted or deasserted.  The set of Event
	States a sensor may support is defined by the sensor's 
	'Event Category.'  A particular sensor, however, does not have to 
	support all the Event States defined for its event category.  
	The specific Event States that a particular sensor supports are 
	indicated in the 'Events' field in the sensor's RDR. A sensor is 
	not required to support any Event States. If no Event States are 
	supported by a sensor, the 'Events' field will be 0x0000.  A sensor 
	may not support any Event States that are not defined for its event 
	category. Each Event State is independent, although in some event 
	categories the meaning assigned to the Event States will imply that 
	certain Event States will be mutually exclusive.  For example, a 
	sensor that uses the SAHPI_EC_LIMIT event category should only have 
	one of the two Event States, SAHPI_ES_LIMIT_NOT_EXCEEDED or 
	SAHPI_ES_LIMIT_EXCEEDED asserted at any one time. Except where mutual 
	exclusion is implied, however, sensors may have multiple Event States 
	asserted simultaneously. For example, the event category 
	SAHPI_EC_THRESHOLD uses six different event states to report the 
	relationship between the value currently measured by the sensor and up 
	to six different 'threshold' values.  Each threshold is independently 
	examined, and each Event State that represents a threshold that has 
	been 'crossed' will be asserted.  Threshold values must be configured 
	so that 'Minor', 'Major' and 'Critical' thresholds are increasingly 
	extreme readings, such that when a 'Major' threshold has been crossed, 
	the corresponding 'Minor' threshold will also have been crossed, and 
	thus both Event States will be asserted. When a sensor Event State is 
	asserted or deasserted, an event may be generated by the resource.  
        The generated event identifies the sensor and the event state 
        being asserted or deasserted.  The HPI implementation may assign event
        severity levels for each event state assertion or deassertion on an 
        individual sensor basis."

reported  by the HPI software implementation. 

Audit events report a discrepancy in the audit process.  
Audits are typically performed by HA software to detect problems.  
Audits may look for such things as corrupted data stores, 
inconsistent RPT information, or improperly managed queues.

Startup events report a failure to start-up properly, or 
inconsistencies in persisted data. 

Note: Enumerated values are increased by one value compared to
SAI-HPI-B spec."

        STATUS          current
        DESCRIPTION     "The table of announcements is used to provide
a common interface to varied mechanisms for announcing conditions.

Each announcement in an Annunciator's current set contains a severity level, details describing the specific condition that is being reported, an Acknowledged flag, a timestamp indicating when the announcement was added to the set, and an EntryId that uniquely identifies the particular status item within the set.

EntryIds are assigned to announcements as they are added to the set as well as a Timestamp.  After an announcement is deleted from the current set, its EntryId may be reused for a newly added announcement as long as the new announcement will have a different timestamp than any previously deleted announcement using the same EntryId.  Thus, the EntryId and Timestamp together will uniquely identify any announcement, which was ever present in the Annunciator's set.

The actual meaning of the Acknowledged flag is arbitrary, and the actions taken by the platform when announcements are flagged as 'acknowledged' or 'unacknowledged' are implementation-specific.  The intended use of the flag is to indicate whether a particular announcement in the current set has been recognized by whomever or whatever is inspecting the LEDs, displays, etc., that are being driven by the Annunciator management instrument.  Thus, when announcements are added to the current set, generally the flag should be set to indicate that the condition is 'unacknowledged'.  Later, either as the result of an HPI User function call, or due to some implementation-dependent action (such as pressing an 'acknowledge' button on a front-panel display), the flag can be changed to indicate that the announcement is now 'acknowledged.'

The ability to acknowledge announcements is not controlled by the Annunciator 'mode' setting (Auto, User, or Shared).  Any announcement may be acknowledged by the HPI implementation, or via the saHpiAnnunciatorAcknowledge() function call, regardless of the current mode setting for the Annunciator.

Over time, announcements are added to and deleted from an Annunciator`s current set of announcements. This may be done automatically by the HPI implementation to reflect platform fault conditions, or by the HPI User via the HPI interface.  When announcements are added or deleted automatically by the HPI implementation, it is implementation-specific which announcements are added or removed.

        Remarks:

    Entries placed in the Event Log after this function is called will have Event Log timestamps (i.e., the Timestamp field in the SaHpiEventLogEntryT structure) based on the new time.  Setting the clock does not affect existing Event Log entries.  If the time is set to a relative time, subsequent entries placed in the Event Log will have an Event Log timestamp expressed as a relative time; if the time is set to an absolute time, subsequent entries will have an Event Log timestamp expressed as an absolute time.  

    This function only sets the Event Log time clock and does not have any direct bearing on the timestamps placed on events (i.e., the Timestamp field in the SaHpiEventT structure), or the timestamps placed in the domain RPT info record.  Setting the clocks used to generate timestamps other than Event Log timestamps is implementation-dependent, and should be documented by the HPI implementation provider.

    Some underlying implementations may not be able to handle the same relative and absolute time ranges, as those defined in HPI.  Such limitations will be documented in implementation-specific documentation.  When a time value is set in a region that is not supported by the implementation, an error code of SNMP_GENERROR  will be returned.

    Refer to SaHpiTime for full description."

        analog   - octets 1-4 represent the value specified in
                   network byte order.

        stream   - A stream control is represented as follows:
                     octet 1    - repeat flag
                     octets 2-5 - count of octets of data stored in the stream specified

                     octets 6-9 - contain the stream data.

                     octet 1    - Line number (255 indicates all lines).

                                Unicode, which requires two bytes of data per

                                those written on the line. Thus writing a
                                zero-length string will clear the addressed line. 
                                It is also possible to include more characters 
                                in the text passed in the CtrlState structure

                                last line written).

                The data will be in saHpiCtrlTextType,

	  no implication regarding the internal consistency of
	  the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
	  the current state of the managed device.

          station wishing to create a new instance of a

          from a particular Inventory Data Repository.
	  In some implementations, certain Areas are intrinsically

	the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
	no implication regarding the internal consistency of
	the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
	the current state of the managed device.

    - `createAndWait(5)', which is supplied by a management
    	station wishing to create a new instance of a

	station is responsible of providing valid values to the
	columnar objects: saHpiFieldIsReadOnly, saHpiFieldType,

        DESCRIPTION     "
The Annunciator table is used to control the set of annunciators associated with a resource.

An Annunciator management instrument holds a set of individual announcements.  The function of the Annunciator is to communicate the contents of its current set via whatever platform-specific mechanism is associated with that particular Annunciator management instrument.  For example, if announcements are to be communicated via lighting a set of LEDs on a front-panel display, the Annunciator management instrument may analyze its current set of announcements and turn on a single LED reflecting the most severe condition found, or turn on a 'System Ok' LED if there are currently no items in the set.  A different Annunciator may continuously scroll each announcement in its set on a text display, as well as turning on LEDs and setting dry-contact relays to reflect the severity of conditions present.  A third Annunciator may announce items in its set by sending messages to a proprietary management system, or by sending emails or pages to a system technician.

The Annunciator provides a common interface to these varied mechanisms for announcing conditions, so the HPI User is not burdened by platform-to-platform differences.  However, the current content of any annunciator management instrument is not defined by the HPI standard in the same way that the contents of the DAT are defined.  Thus, the HPI implementation and HPI Users can exert more control over what conditions should be announced.  Further, a platform can contain multiple Annunciator management instruments, each reflecting a different physical announcement device in the platform.  By exposing each separately, HPI Users and the HPI implementation can control which conditions are handled by each announcement device.
An Annunciator management instrument may be implemented using other HPI controls that are in 'auto' mode; for example, digital controls to turn LEDs on and off, stream controls to sound audible alerts, and/or text controls to display detailed information.  However, Annunciators may also operate directly to report conditions using mechanisms that are not themselves visible directly in the HPI interface.

Over time, announcements are added to and deleted from an Annunciator`s current set of announcements. This may be done automatically by the HPI implementation to reflect platform fault conditions, or by the HPI User via the HPI interface.  When announcements are added or deleted automatically by the HPI implementation, it is implementation-specific which announcements are added or removed.

		implementation will not automatically add or delete announcements. 	 
	shared(3) -  the HPI implementation automatically adds and deletes 
		announcements, and the HPI User may also add and delete announcements. 	 
  	 
	The initial mode of each Annunciator is implementation-specific.  The HPI 
	User may change the mode of Annunciators with the saHpiAnnunciatorMode object.  
	However, the mode may be configured to be Read-only, in which case the HPI

	When the mode is user(2) or shared(3), HPI Users may add or delete any types 
	of announcements in the Annunciator's current set - not just HPI User announcements.  
	This is allowed so that the HPI User can exert complete control over what conditions 
	are being announced, if that is required.  Note that this is less restrictive than 
	the similar operations on the DAT.  To distinguish between announcements added to 
	an Annunciator automatically and those added by an HPI User, an saHpiAddedByUser 
	field in the announcement indicates the source of the announcement in the set.
