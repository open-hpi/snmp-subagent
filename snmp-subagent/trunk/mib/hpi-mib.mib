    DESCRIPTION
	"This MIB defines the HPI instrumentation based on
	'Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface'
	(SA-HPI-B.01.01).

	This MIB module defines a set of objects that allow the 
         management of entities on a variety of hardware platforms.  The  
         abstractions presented in this MIB are derived from the 
                  Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface 
                  specification version 01.01.
           
         The MIB views a hardware platform as a collection of physical 
                  entities that can be managed individually.  A logical 
                  collection of entities comprises a management domain.

         Each entity has a common set of attributes reflected in the 
         entity table.  Entities may have additional categorical 
                  attributes that may exist in one or more of the hotswap 
                  table, control table, sensor table, watchdog table,
		  inventory control table and config table.

         The hotswap table defines management attributes
         for an entity that supports hotswap, generally referred to as 
                  a FRU.

         The controls table defines variables for reading and setting 
                  controls associated with an entity.

         The sensors table defines variables for reading sensors 
                  associated with an entity as well as controlling event 
                  generation for that sensor.

	The watchdog table defines variables for reading watchdog
		  associated with an entitry.

	The inventory control defines variables for reading inventory
		resources.  
    
	This MIB is version 1.3.1"

SaHpiTime ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
	"
 An HPI time value represents the local time as the number of nanoseconds
 from 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, in a 64-bit signed integer. This format
 is sufficient to represent times with nano-second resolution from the
 year 1678 to 2262. Every API which deals with time values must define
 the timezone used.

 It should be noted that although nano-second resolution is supported
 in the data type, the actual resolution provided by an implementation
 may be more limited than this.

 The value -263, which is 0x8000000000000000, is used to indicate
 'unknown/unspecified time'.

 Conversion to/from POSIX and other common time representations is
 relatively straightforward. The following code framgment converts
 between SaHpiTimeT and time_t:

     time_t tt1, tt2;
     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

     time(&tt1);
     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tt1  1000000000;
     tt2 = saHpiTime / 1000000000;

The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timeval:

     struct timeval tv1, tv2;
     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

     gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tv1.tv_sec  1000000000 + tv1.tv_usec  1000;
     tv2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
     tv2.tv_usec = saHpiTime % 1000000000 / 1000;

 The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timespec:

     struct timespec ts1, ts2;
     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

     clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts1);
     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) ts1.tv_sec  1000000000 + ts1.tv_nsec;
     ts2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
     ts2.tv_nsec = saHpiTime % 1000000000;

 Note, however, that since time_t is (effectively) universally 32 bits,
 all of these conversions will cease to work on January 18, 2038.

 Some subsystems may need the flexibility to report either absolute or
 relative (eg. to system boot) times. This will typically be in the
 case of a board which may or may not, depending on the system setup,
 have an idea of absolute time. For example, some boards may have
 'time of day' clocks which start at zero, and never get set to the
 time of day.

 In these cases, times which represent 'current' time (in events, for
 example) can be reported based on the clock value, whether it has been
 set to the actual date/time, or whether it represents the elapsed time
 since boot. If it is the time since boot, the value will be (for 27
 years) less than 0x0C00000000000000, which is Mon May 26 16:58:48 1997.
 If the value is greater than this, then it can be assumed to be an
 absolute time.

 Every API which can report either absolute or relative times must
 state this rule clearly in its interface specification.

 Maximum time that can be specified as relative :

SaHpiHotSwapState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS	current
    DESCRIPTION
	"Hot Swap states.

inactive(1):

	The INACTIVE state indicates that the FRU, which supports the full hot swap model, is no longer active in the system, and that it has completed the extraction process. When a FRU completes the hardware disconnection process, it is logically and electrically disconnected or isolated from the platform but still physically located in the platform, so the associated resource remains in the domain. Typically, a FRU will be powered off or held in reset when in this state. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INACTIVE when the resource is transitioning to an INACTIVE state.

insertionPending(2):

	The INSERTION PENDING state is entered after a resource that supports the full hot swap model has been added to the domain, as a result of the associated FRU being physically inserted into the system. This state indicates the resource is transitioning from a NOT PRESENT state or INACTIVE state into the ACTIVE state. When transitioning into the INSERTION PENDING state, the resource should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INSERTION_PENDING. The event can be generated when the ejector latch is shut (cPCI) or the device is seated in a slot. 
	Upon receiving the event, the HPI User has the opportunity to discover the capabilities of the resource before allowing the FRU associated with the resource to power on and become an active component in the system. During this state, the FRU can be commanded to power on or de-assert reset.


active(3):

	The ACTIVE state indicates that a resource is now an active member of the domain.

	After a FRU completes the hardware connection process, the associated resource enters the ACTIVE state. This does not mean that the FRU is now active at the software level, but merely indicates that the FRU is now active in the system and that it should not be abruptly removed. The HPI implementation generates a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_ACTIVE when the resource transitions to the ACTIVE state.

extractionPending(4):

	The EXTRACTION PENDING state indicates that the resource, which supports the full hot swap model, has requested extraction of the associated FRU. Typically, a resource enters an EXTRACTION PENDING state when an ejector latch is opened (PICMG 2.1) or when a hot swap button is pressed. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_EXTRACTION_PENDING when a resource that supports Managed Hot Swap requests extraction. 
	Upon receiving the event, the HPI User has the opportunity to unload software drivers, relocate processes, or unmount file systems (software disconnect) before allowing a FRU to power down and disconnect from the system.

notPresent(5):

	 The NOT PRESENT state is actually a virtual state that represents a resource that is not currently present in the domain, because the FRU associated with that resource is not currently present in the system. A resource is in this state before the FRU is physically inserted into the system or if it has been removed from the system. A resource that supports the full Hot Swap model typically transitions to this state from the INACTIVE state, but a resource can transition to this state from any state due to a surprise extraction of the FRU. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_NOT_PRESENT when the resource transitions from any state to the NOT PRESENT state.

	 The event can indicate a normal transition from INACTIVE to the NOT PRESENT state or a surprise extraction from any other state.  Normal transition events are issued with a severity of SAHPI_INFORMATIONAL. A resource following the simplified hot swap model always indicates the transition to the NOT PRESENT state as a surprise extraction.
	 When a resource associated with a FRU fails, many systems will detect this as a NOT PRESENT state for the FRU, and report it as a transition to the NOT PRESENT state (a normal transition if the resource was in the INACTIVE state, or a surprise extraction if it was in a different state).  If the resource is subsequently restored to functionality, these systems will then detect the presence of the FRU, and report another state transition from the NOT PRESENT state to the current hot swap state for the restored resource.  If the current hot swap state is not the normal ~initial~ state for the FRU when it is inserted (i.e., INSERTION PENDING for a resource that uses the full hot swap model or ACTIVE for a resource that uses the simplified hot swap model), then the severity of the ~unusual~ hot swap event showing a transition from NOT PRESENT to a different state should be the severity contained in the ResourceSeverity field in the resource~s RPT entry."

	Resource Capabilities
	
	This definition defines the capabilities of a given resource.
	One resource may support any number of capabilities using this
	string (each capability has to be seperated by a delimeter). 

	Because each entry in an RPT will have the 
	RESOURCE string, no value  is not a valid value for the 
	capability flag, and is thus used to indicate 'no RPT
	entry present' in some function calls.
	
	RESOURCE
	EVT_DEASSERTS

	Indicates that all sensors on the resource have the property that their
	Assertion and Deassertion event enable flags are the same. That is,
	for all event states whose assertion triggers an event, it is
	guaranteed that the deassertion of that event will also
	trigger an event. 
	
	Thus, an HPI User may track the state of sensors on the
	resource by monitoring events rather than polling for state changes.

	AGGREGATE_STATUS

	MANAGED_HOTSWAP

	Indicates that the resource supports the full managed hot swap model.

	WATCHDOG
	CONTROL
	FRU

	Indicates that the resource is a field-replaceable unit; i.e., it is
	capable of being removed and replaced in a live system. If
	MANAGED_HOTSWAP is also set, the resource supports
	the full hot swap model.  If MANAGED_HOTSWAP is not

If, during this time period, a saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel function call is processed, the timer will be stopped, and the auto-insertion policy will not be invoked.  Each domain maintains a single auto-insert timeout value and it is applied to all contained resources upon insertion, which support managed hot swap.
Once the auto-insertion process begins, the HPI User will not be allowed to take control of the insertion process; hence, the timeout should be set appropriately to allow for this condition.  Note that the timeout period begins when the hot swap event with saHpiHotSwapState == INSERTION_PENDING is initially generated."

 - use this function to request a resource to return to the ACTIVE state from the EXTRACTION PENDING state in order to reject an extraction request.
Because a resource that supports the simplified hot swap model will never transition into INSERTION PENDING or EXTRACTION PENDING states, this function is not applicable to those resources.

 - use this function to request a resource to return to the INACTIVE state from the INSERTION PENDING state to abort a hot-swap insertion action.
Because a resource that supports the simplified hot swap model will never transition into INSERTION PENDING or EXTRACTION PENDING states, this function is not applicable to those resources."

    DESCRIPTION
	"This function gets the reset state of an entity, allowing the HPI User to determine if the entity is being held with its reset asserted. If a resource manages multiple entities, this function will address the entity which is identified in the RPT entry for the resource.

coldReset(1) and warmReset(2) are pulsed resets, and are not valid values to be returned in saHpiResetAction. 

	If the entity is not being held in reset (using resetAssert(3)), the appropriate value is resetDeAssert(4)."

    MAX-ACCESS	read-write
    STATUS	current
    DESCRIPTION
	"This function gets the power state of an entity, allowing the HPI User to determine if the entity is currently powered on or off. If a resource manages multiple entities, this function will address the entity which is identified in the RPT entry for the resource.

cycle(3) is a pulsed power operation and is not a valid return for the power state.

This function controls the hardware power on a FRU entity regardless of what hot-swap state the resource is in. For example, it is legal (and may be desirable) to cycle power on the FRU even while it is in ACTIVE state in order to attempt to clear a fault condition. Similarly, a resource could be instructed to power on a FRU even while it is in INACTIVE state, for example, in order to run off-line diagnostics.
Not all resources supporting hot swap will necessarily support this function. In particular, resources that use the simplified hot swap model may not have the ability to control FRU power. 
This function may also be supported for non-FRU entities if power control is available for those entities."

	Remarks:

    Entries placed in the Event Log after this function is called will have Event Log timestamps (i.e., the Timestamp field in the SaHpiEventLogEntryT structure) based on the new time.  Setting the clock does not affect existing Event Log entries.  If the time is set to a relative time, subsequent entries placed in the Event Log will have an Event Log timestamp expressed as a relative time; if the time is set to an absolute time, subsequent entries will have an Event Log timestamp expressed as an absolute time.  

    This function only sets the Event Log time clock and does not have any direct bearing on the timestamps placed on events (i.e., the Timestamp field in the SaHpiEventT structure), or the timestamps placed in the domain RPT info record.  Setting the clocks used to generate timestamps other than Event Log timestamps is implementation-dependent, and should be documented by the HPI implementation provider.

    Some underlying implementations may not be able to handle the same relative and absolute time ranges, as those defined in HPI.  Such limitations will be documented in implementation-specific documentation.  When a time value is set in a region that is not supported by the implementation, an error code of SNMP_GENERROR  will be returned.

    Refer to SaHpiTime for full describption."

        discrete - Unsigned 32bit integer  (4 octets)

        analog   - octets 1-4 represent the value specified in
		   network byte order.

        stream   - A stream control is represented as follows:
                     octet 1    - repeat flag
                     octets 2-5 - count of octets of data stored in the stream specified

                     octets 6-9 - contain the stream data.

        text     - Text control attributes are represented as follows:
                     octet 1    - Line number (255 indicates all lines).
				When reading:
				Note that depending on the data type and 
				language, the text may be encoded in 2-byte 
				Unicode, which requires two bytes of data per
				character.

				When writting:
				If less than a full line of data is written, 
				the control will clear all spaces beyond 
				those written on the line. Thus writing a
				zero-length string will clear the addressed line. 
				It is also possible to include more characters 
				in the text passed in the CtrlState structure 
				than will fit on one line; in this case, 
				the control will 'wrap' to the next line 
				(still clearing the trailing characters on the
				last line written).

		The data will be in saHpiCtrlTextType, 
		saHpiCtrlTextLanguage, and saHpiCtrlText.


        oem      - An oem control is represented as follows:
                     octets 1-4   - manufacturer ID in network byte order

		The oem text data is located in saHpiCtrlText.
		The saHpiCtrlTextType and saHpiCtrlTextLanguage are both
		set to undefined (0).
