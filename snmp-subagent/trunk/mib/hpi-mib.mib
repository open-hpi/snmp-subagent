    DESCRIPTION
    
        "When using this MIB it is strongly recommend to use a SNMP v2 or v3c
	SNMP protocol due to security concerns.
	
	Additionally  if fine grain access configuration is desired, for 
	example to manage access to indiviual columnar nodes, the SNMP 
	configuration should use VACM (View Based Access Control Model 
	- RFC 2275).
	
	This MIB defines the HPI instrumentation based on
        'Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface'
        (SAI-HPI-B.01.01).

        This MIB module defines a set of objects that allow the 
        management of entities on a variety of hardware platforms.  The  
        abstractions presented in this MIB are derived from the 
        Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface 
        specification version SAI-HPI-B.01.01.
           
        The MIB views a hardware platform as a collectionsa of physical 
                  entities that can be managed individually.  A logical 
                  collection of entities comprises a management domain.

         Each entity has a common set of attributes reflected in the 
         entity table.  Entities may have additional categorical 
                  attributes that may exist in one or more of the hotswap 
                  table, control table, sensor table, watchdog table,
                  inventory control table and config table.

         The hotswap table defines management attributes
         for an entity that supports hotswap, generally referred to as 
                  a FRU.

         The controls table defines variables for reading and setting 
                  controls associated with an entity.

         The sensors table defines variables for reading sensors 
                  associated with an entity as well as controlling event 
                  generation for that sensor.

        The watchdog table defines variables for reading watchdog
                  associated with an entitry.

        The inventory control defines variables for reading inventory
                resources and changing the settings.

SaHpiTime ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
	STATUS       current
	DESCRIPTION
	"This textual convention defines the HPI time value as 
	an 64-bit value.

	An HPI time value represents the local time as the number of nanoseconds
	from 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, in a 64-bit signed integer. This format
	is sufficient to represent times with nano-second resolution from the
	year 1678 to 2262. Every API which deals with time values must define
	the timezone used.
	
	It should be noted that although nano-second resolution is supported
	in the data type, the actual resolution provided by an implementation
	may be more limited than this.
	
	The value -2^63, which is 0x8000000000000000, is used to indicate
	'unknown/unspecified time'.
	
	Conversion to/from POSIX and other common time representations is
	relatively straightforward. The following code framgment converts
	between SaHpiTimeT and time_t:

	time_t tt1, tt2;
	SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

	time(&tt1);
	saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tt1  1000000000;
	tt2 = saHpiTime / 1000000000;

	The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timeval:

	struct timeval tv1, tv2;
	SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

	gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
	saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tv1.tv_sec  1000000000 + tv1.tv_usec  1000;
	tv2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
	tv2.tv_usec = saHpiTime % 1000000000 / 1000;

	The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timespec:

	struct timespec ts1, ts2;
	SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

	clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts1);
	saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) ts1.tv_sec  1000000000 + ts1.tv_nsec;
	ts2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
	ts2.tv_nsec = saHpiTime % 1000000000;

	Note, however, that since time_t is (effectively) universally 32 bits,
	all of these conversions will cease to work on January 18, 2038.

	Some subsystems may need the flexibility to report either absolute or
	relative (eg. to system boot) times. This will typically be in the
	case of a board which may or may not, depending on the system setup,
	have an idea of absolute time. For example, some boards may have
	'time of day' clocks which start at zero, and never get set to the
	time of day.

	In these cases, times which represent 'current' time (in events, for
	example) can be reported based on the clock value, whether it has been
	set to the actual date/time, or whether it represents the elapsed time
	since boot. If it is the time since boot, the value will be (for 27
	years) less than 0x0C00000000000000, which is Mon May 26 16:58:48 1997.
	If the value is greater than this, then it can be assumed to be an
	absolute time.

	Every API which can report either absolute or relative times must
	state this rule clearly in its interface specification.

	SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED     0x8000000000000000LL

	Maximum time that can be specified as relative :
	SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE     0x0C00000000000000LL
	
	Used when textual convention is used to specify a time value
	conveying a non-blocking action.  Take action immediately.
	SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE    0x0000000000000000LL

	Used when textual convention is used to specify a time value 
	conveying a time independent wait should accur.  Wait for all time if 
	necessary.

SaHpiEventState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

	STATUS       current 
	DESCRIPTION 
	"The following event states are available for variables using the 
	saHpiEventCategory textual convention to provide event origin 
	information.
 
        Each set of events is uniquely identified with a label which easily 
	refers back to the corresponding category. Only events from the same 
	category should be coalesced in a variable of this type.
 
        Each event will have one or more event states seperated by a common 
	delimiter (, or ;) associated with it. When retrieving the event 
	status, all applicable event states can be used.  

	Similarly, when setting the event enabled status a set 
        of all applicable event states can be used.

     	For example, for the type threshold(2), the retrieved states can
        be:
 
        LOWER_MINOR, UPPER_CRIT, UPPER_MAJOR
        
        When the event category is the unspecified(0) type, the event can be:
 
        UNSPECIFIED 
 
        Event category of type threshold(2), can have the following values :
        
        LOWER_MINOR 
        LOWER_MAJOR
        LOWER_CRIT
        UPPER_MINOR
        UPPER_MAJOR
        UPPER_CRIT
 
        Event category of type usage(3), can have :
        
        IDLE
        ACTIVE
        BUSY
 
        Event category of type state(4), can have :

SaHpiHotSwapState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
	STATUS      current
	DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines the enumeration of states
	specific to Hot Swap records. They are:

        inactive(1):

        The inactive(1) state indicates that the FRU, which supports the 
	full hot swap model, is no longer active in the system, and that 
	it has completed the extraction process. When a FRU completes the 
	hardware disconnection process, it is logically and electrically 
	disconnected or isolated from the platform but still physically 
	located in the platform, so the associated resource remains in the 
	domain. Typically, a FRU will be powered off or held in reset when 
	in this state. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap 
	event with SaHpiHotSwapState = inactive(1) when the resource 
	is transitioning to an inactive(1) state.

        insertionPending(2):

        The insertionPending(2) state is entered after a resource that supports 
	the full hot swap model has been added to the domain, as a result of 
	the associated FRU being physically inserted into the system. This 
	state indicates the resource is transitioning from a notPresent(5) 
	state or inactive(1) state into the ACTIVE state. When transitioning into 
	the insertionPending(2) state, the resource should generate a hot swap 
	event with SaHpiHotSwapState = insertionPending(2). The event 
	can be generated when the ejector latch is shut (cPCI) or the device 
	is seated in a slot. 
        Upon receiving the event, the HPI User has the opportunity to discover 
	the capabilities of the resource before allowing the FRU associated with 
	the resource to power on and become an active component in the system. 
	During this state, the FRU can be commanded to power on or de-assert reset.


        active(3):

        The active(3) state indicates that a resource is now an active member of 
	the domain.

        After a FRU completes the hardware connection process, the associated 
	resource enters the active(3) state. This does not mean that the FRU is 
	now active at the software level, but merely indicates that the FRU 
	is now active in the system and that it should not be abruptly removed. 
	The HPI implementation generates a hot swap event with 
	SaHpiHotSwapState = active(3) when the resource transitions to the 
	active(3) state.

        extractionPending(4):

        The extractionPending(4) state indicates that the resource, which 
	supports the full hot swap model, has requested extraction of the 
	associated FRU.

	 Typically, a resource enters an extractionPending(4) state when an 
	ejector latch is opened (PICMG 2.1) or when a hot swap button is 
	pressed. The HPI implementation should generate a hot swap event with 
	 SaHpiHotSwapState = extractionPending(4) when a resource that 
	 supports Managed Hot Swap requests extraction. 
        Upon receiving the event, the HPI User has the opportunity to unload 
	software drivers, relocate processes, or unmount file systems 
	(software disconnect) before allowing a FRU to power down and disconnect 
	from the system.

        notPresent(5):

         The notPresent(5) state is actually a virtual state that represents 
	 a resource that is not currently present in the domain, because the 
	 FRU associated with that resource is not currently present in the system. 
	 A resource is in this state before the FRU is physically inserted into 
	 the system or if it has been removed from the system. A resource that 
	 supports the full Hot Swap model typically transitions to this state 
	 from the inactive(1) state, but a resource can transition to this state 
	 from any state due to a surprise extraction of the FRU. The HPI 
	 implementation should generate a hot swap event with 
	 SaHpiHotSwapState = notPresent(5) when the resource transitions 
	 from any state to the notPresent(5) state.

         The event can indicate a normal transition from inactive(1) to the 
	 notPresent(5) state or a surprise extraction from any other state.  
	 Normal transition events are issued with a severity of informational(4).

	 A resource following the simplified hot swap model always indicates the 
	  transition to the notPresent(5) state as a surprise extraction.
         When a resource associated with a FRU fails, many systems will detect 
	 this as a notPresent(5) state for the FRU, and report it as a transition 
	 to the notPresent(5) state (a normal transition if the resource was in the 
	 inactive(1) state, or a surprise extraction if it was in a different state).  
	 If the resource is subsequently restored to functionality, these systems 
	 will then detect the presence of the FRU, and report another state 
	 transition from the notPresent(5) state to the current hot swap state for 
	 the restored resource.  If the current hot swap state is not the normal 
	 ~initial~ state for the FRU when it is inserted (i.e., insertionPending(2) 
	 for a resource that uses the full hot swap model or active(3) for a resource 
	 that uses the simplified hot swap model), then the severity of the 
	 ~unusual~ hot swap event showing a transition from notPresent(5) to a 
	 different state should be the severity contained in the ResourceSeverity 
	 field in the resource~s RPT entry.

	SAI-HPI-B spec."

        Unicode 2.0. The first 256 codes of Unicode follow ISO 646 (ASCII)
        and ISO 8859/1 (Latin 1). The Unicode 'C0 Controls and Basic Latin'
        set defines the first 128 8-bit characters (00h-7Fh) and the

        Note: The bcdplus(2) and ascii6(3) encodings
        use normal ASCII character encodings, but restrict the allowed
        characters to a subset of the entire ASCII character set. These
        encodings are used when the target device contains restrictions
        on which characters it can store or display.  BCDPLUS 
        data may be stored externally as 4-bit values, and 
        ASCII6 may be stored externally as 6-bit values. 
        But, regardless of how the data is stored externally, it is 
        encoded as 8-bit ASCII in the SaHpiText structure passed 
        across the HPI.

	domain, that are in a peer or tiered domain relationship.

	The DRT contains an entry for each associated domain, and HPI MIB Users 
	may read these entries to discover the presence of additional domains within 
	a 'System'. The discovered domains can, in turn, be used to discover additional 
	resources and domains. The DRT is automatically built and maintained by the HPI 
	implementation.  Domain entries in the DRT may change over time if the 'System'
	configuration changes.  

	There are two types of domain references:

	- A peer domain architecture, which consists of two or more domains that are 
	expected to contain the same resources and domain references.  Each domain 
	in a peer relationship contains an RPT listing all resources present in each 
	domain. 

	- A tiered (child) domain architecture is used when all the resources in a 
	'system' cannot be accessed in a single domain.  A 'parent' domain references 
	one or more 'child' domains in its DRT.  The 'child' domains may be simple 
	domains containing only resources, or they may themselves be a 'parent' to 
	other 'child' domains.  Domains in a tiered relationship are disjointed and 
	do not contain the same resources."

        DESCRIPTION     "
        An HPI SNMP Manager acknowledges an alarm to indicate that it is aware of the alarm 
        and to influence platform-specific alarm annunciation that may be provided  
        by the implementation.  Typically, an implementation ignores acknowledged   
        alarms when announcing an alarm on annunciation devices such as audible     
        sirens and dry contact closures.  However, alarm annunciation is            
        implementation-specific.                                                    
                                                                                    
        An acknowledged alarm will have the Acknowledged field in the alarm entry   
        set to True.                                                                
                                                                                    
        DomainAlarms are acknowledged by one of two ways: a single alarm entry by DomainAlarmId 
        regardless of severity or as a group of alarm entries by Severity           
        regardless of DomainAlarmId.                                                      
                                                                                    
        To acknowledge all alarms contained within the DAT, set the Severity        
        parameter to allSeverities(256), and set the DomainAlarmId parameter to         
        SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.                                                    
                                                                                    
        To acknowledge all alarms of a specific severity contained within the DAT,  
        set the Severity parameter to the appropriate value, and set the DomainAlarmId    
        parameter to SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.                                       
                                                                                    
        To acknowledge a single alarm entry, set the DomainAlarmId parameter to a value   
        other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.  The DomainAlarmId must be a valid identifier 
        for an alarm entry present in the DAT at the time of the function call.     
                                                                                    
        If an alarm has been previously acknowledged, acknowledging it again has no 
        effect.  However, this is not an error.                                     
                                                                                    
        If the DomainAlarmId parameter has a value other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED,    
        the Severity parameter is ignored.                                          
                                                                                    
        If the DomainAlarmId parameter is passed as SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED, and no       
        alarms are present that meet the requested Severity, this function will     
        have no effect.  However, this is not an error.                             
                                                                                    
        SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED is defined as the same value as SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY,  
        so using either symbol will have the same effect.  However,                 
        SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED should be used with this function for clarity.

	- `notInService(2)', which indicates that the conceptual
	row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
	the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
	no implication regarding the internal consistency of
	the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
	the current state of the managed device.

	- `createAndWait(5)', which is supplied by a management
	station wishing to create a new instance of a
	conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
	the managed device). This operation is used to add a User 
	Alarm to the Domain Alarm Table.  It also subsequently 
	appears in the User Event Table (a duplicate).
	The row is created (and changes state to 'active' when 
	the saHpiDomainAlarmSeverity has been set on) to a 
	new instance of the conceptual row. The dis-allowed 
	saHpiDomainAlarmSeverity values are minor(3), major(2), and
	critical(3). 

	- `destroy(6)', which is supplied by a management station
	wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
	an existing conceptual row. This function allows the 
	HPI MIB User to delete a single User Alarm or a group 
	identified by  severity (saHpiDomainAlarmSeverity) from
	the Domain Alarm Table. Note this has no efect on the 'User 
	Event Table.'  Only User Alarms added to the DAT can be 
	deleted. 
	
	To delete a single, specific alarm, set the 
	saHpiDomainAlarmId parameter to a value representing an 
	actual User Alarm ( all three indices must be valid)
	in the DAT.  
	
	To delete a group of User Alarms by 
	severity set saHpiDomainAlarmId == SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED
	(see textual convention for more details.)"

	"Resource Capabilities
	
        This definition defines the capabilities of a given resource by 
	using a bit values.  One resource may support any number of 
	capabilities using the bits.

        Because each entry in an Resource Table will have the 
        resource(15) bit set; undefined(0) is not a valid value for the 
        capability flag, and is thus would be used to indicate 
	'no resource present in' in some objects.
        
        resource(15) 
        evtDeAsserts(14) 

        Indicates that all sensors on the resource have the property that their
        Assertion and Deassertion event enable flags are the same. That is,
        for all event states whose assertion triggers an event, it is
        guaranteed that the deassertion of that event will also
        trigger an event. 
        
        Thus, an HPI SNMP Manager may track the state of sensors on the
        resource by monitoring events rather than polling for state changes.

        aggregateStatus(13)
        configuration(12)
        managedHotSwap(11) 

        Indicates that the resource supports the full managed hot swap model. 
        Since hot swap only makes sense for field-replaceable units, the 
        FRU capability string must also be set for this columnar object.

        watchdog(10)
        control(9)
        fru(8)

        Indicates that the resource is a field-replaceable unit; i.e., it is
        capable of being removed and replaced in a live system. If
        managedHotSwap(11) is also set, the resource supports
        the full hot swap model.  If managedHotSwap(11) is not
        set, the resource supports the simplified hot swap model.

        reset(5)
        inventoryData(4)
        eventLog(3)
        rdr(2)

        Indicates that a resource data record (RDR) repository is supplied
        by the resource. Since the existence of an RDR is mandatory for all
        management instruments, this capability must be asserted if the 
        resource contains any annunciators, sensors, controls, watchdog timers

	"This function allows the HPI SNMP Manager to configure a timeout for

	on a resource within a specific domain.  

	This columnar node accepts a parameter instructing each resource to impose 
	a delay before performing its default hot swap policy for 
	auto-insertion.  The parameter may be set to 
		SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE 
			( see SaHpiTime Textual-Convention for further details)
	to direct resources to proceed immediately to auto-insertion, or to 
		SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK 
			( see SaHpiTime Textual-Convention for further details)
	to prevent auto-insertion from ever occurring.
	If the parameter is set to another value, then it defines the number 
	of nanoseconds between the time a hot swap event with 
	saHpiHotSwapState == insertionPending(5) is generated, and the time 
	that the auto-insertion policy will be invoked for that resource.  
	If, during this time period, a saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel function 
	call is processed, the timer will be stopped, and the auto-insertion 
	policy will not be invoked.  Each domain maintains a single 
	auto-insert timeout value and it is applied to all contained resources 
	upon insertion, which support managed hot swap. Once the auto-insertion 
	process begins, the HPI SNMP Manager will not be allowed to take control of 
	the insertion process; hence, the timeout should be set appropriately 
	to allow for this condition.  Note that the timeout period begins 
	when the hot swap event with saHpiHotSwapState == insertionPending(5) 
	is initially generated."

        a hot swap indicator such as a blue LED. This indicator signifies 
        that the FRU is ready for removal. 

        This columnar node allows the HPI SNMP Manager to retrieve and set the
        state of this indicator. 

        When retrieving the values, the valid states are either 
		saHpiHotSwapIndicator == off(1)
	or 
		saHpiHotSwapIndicator == on(2).
        This columnar node will return information, regardless of 
	what hot swap state the resource is in.

        When setting the values,  valid states include
		saHpiHotSwapIndicator == off(1)
	or 
		saHpiHotSwapIndicator == on(2). 
        This function will set the indicator regardless of what hot swap 
        state the resource is in, though it is recommended that this
        function be used only in conjunction with moving the resource to 
        the appropriate hot swap state."

        DESCRIPTION
        "This function allows the HPI SNMP Manager to configure a timeout for how 
        long to wait before the default auto-extraction policy is invoked. 
        This function accepts a parameter instructing the resource to impose
        a delay before performing its default hot swap policy for 
        auto-extraction. The parameter may be set to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE
        to direct the resource to proceed immediately to auto-extraction, or
        to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK to prevent auto-extraction from ever occurring
        on a resource. If the parameter is set to another value, then it
        defines the number of nanoseconds between the time a hot swap event 
        with saHpiHotSwapState = extractionPending(4) is generated and the 
        time that the auto-extraction policy will be invoked for the
        resource. If, during this time period, a saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel 
        function call is processed, the timer will be stopped, and the 
        auto-extraction policy will not be invoked. 

        Once the auto-extraction process begins, the HPI SNMP Manager will not be 
        allowed to take control of the extraction process; hence, the 
        timeout should be set appropriately to allow for this condition. 

        Note that the timeout period begins when the hot swap event with 
        saHpiHotSwapState = extractionPending(4) is initially generated.

        DESCRIPTION
        "A resource supporting hot swap typically supports default policies for 
        insertion and extraction. On insertion, the default policy may be for 
        the resource to turn the associated FRU~s local power on and to 
        de-assert reset. On extraction, the default policy may be for the 
        resource to immediately power off the FRU and turn on a hot swap 
        indicator. This function allows an HPI SNMP Manager, after receiving a hot 
        swap event with saHpiHotSwapState equal to INSERTION_PENDING or 
        EXTRACTION_PENDING, to prevent the default policy from being executed.  

        Once the resource transitions to either the ACTIVE or inactive(1) state, 
        the default policies will once again execute, unless cancelled using 
        saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel.

        The default policy cannot be canceled once it has begun to execute.  

        Because a resource that supports the simplified hot swap model will 
        never transition into insertionPending(2) or extractionPending(4) states, 
        this function is not applicable to those resources.

        DESCRIPTION
        "Sensor Events and Sensor Event States:
        Each Event State may be asserted or deasserted.  The set of Event
	States a sensor may support is defined by the sensor's 
	'Event Category.'  A particular sensor, however, does not have to 
	support all the Event States defined for its event category.  
	The specific Event States that a particular sensor supports are 
	indicated in the 'Events' field in the sensor's RDR. A sensor is 
	not required to support any Event States. If no Event States are 
	supported by a sensor, the 'Events' field will be 0x0000.  A sensor 
	may not support any Event States that are not defined for its event 
	category. Each Event State is independent, although in some event 
	categories the meaning assigned to the Event States will imply that 
	certain Event States will be mutually exclusive.  For example, a 
	sensor that uses the limit(6) event category should only have 
	one of the two Event States, SAHPI_ES_LIMIT_NOT_EXCEEDED or 
	SAHPI_ES_LIMIT_EXCEEDED asserted at any one time. Except where mutual 
	exclusion is implied, however, sensors may have multiple Event States 
	asserted simultaneously. For example, the event category 
	threshold(2) uses six different event states to report the 
	relationship between the value currently measured by the sensor and up 
	to six different 'threshold' values.  Each threshold is independently 
	examined, and each Event State that represents a threshold that has 
	been 'crossed' will be asserted.  Threshold values must be configured 
	so that 'Minor', 'Major' and 'Critical' thresholds are increasingly 
	extreme readings, such that when a 'Major' threshold has been crossed, 
	the corresponding 'Minor' threshold will also have been crossed, and 
	thus both Event States will be asserted. When a sensor Event State is 
	asserted or deasserted, an event may be generated by the resource.  
        The generated event identifies the sensor and the event state 
        being asserted or deasserted.  The HPI implementation may assign event
        severity levels for each event state assertion or deassertion on an 
        individual sensor basis."

        STATUS          current
        DESCRIPTION     "The table of announcements is used to provide
	a common interface to varied mechanisms for announcing conditions.

	Each announcement in an Annunciator's current set contains a severity
	level, details describing the specific condition that is being reported, 
	an Acknowledged flag, a timestamp indicating when the announcement was 
	added to the set, and an EntryId that uniquely identifies the particular 
	status item within the set.

	EntryIds are assigned to announcements as they are added to the set as 
	well as a Timestamp.  After an announcement is deleted from the current 
	set, its EntryId may be reused for a newly added announcement as long 
	as the new announcement will have a different timestamp than any 
	previously deleted announcement using the same EntryId.  Thus, the 
	EntryId and Timestamp together will uniquely identify any announcement, 
	which was ever present in the Annunciator's set.

	The actual meaning of the Acknowledged flag is arbitrary, and the 
	actions taken by the platform when announcements are flagged as 
	'acknowledged' or 'unacknowledged' are implementation-specific.  
	The intended use of the flag is to indicate whether a particular 
	announcement in the current set has been recognized by whomever or 
	whatever is inspecting the LEDs, displays, etc., that are being 
	driven by the Annunciator management instrument.  Thus, when 
	announcements are added to the current set, generally the flag 
	should be set to indicate that the condition is 'unacknowledged'.  
	Later, either as the result of an HPI SNMP Manager function call, or due 
	to some implementation-dependent action (such as pressing an 
	'acknowledge' button on a front-panel display), the flag can be 
	changed to indicate that the announcement is now 'acknowledged.'

	The ability to acknowledge announcements is not controlled 
	by the Annunciator 'mode' setting (Auto, User, or Shared).  
	Any announcement may be acknowledged by the HPI implementation, 
	or via the saHpiAnnunciatorAcknowledge() function call, regardless 
	of the current mode setting for the Annunciator.

	Over time, announcements are added to and deleted from an 
	Annunciator`s current set of announcements. This may be done 
	automatically by the HPI implementation to reflect platform fault 
	conditions, or by the HPI SNMP Manager via the HPI interface.  When 
	announcements are added or deleted automatically by the HPI 
	implementation, it is implementation-specific which announcements 
	are added or removed.

        Remarks:

	Entries placed in the Event Log after this function is 
	called will have Event Log timestamps (i.e., the Timestamp 
	field in the SaHpiEventLogEntryT structure) based on the 
	new time.  Setting the clock does not affect existing Event 
	Log entries.  If the time is set to a relative time, subsequent 
	entries placed in the Event Log will have an Event Log 
	timestamp expressed as a relative time; if the time is set to 
	an absolute time, subsequent entries will have an Event Log 
	timestamp expressed as an absolute time.  

	This function only sets the Event Log time clock and does not have 
	any direct bearing on the timestamps placed on events (i.e., the 
	Timestamp field in the SaHpiEventT structure), or the timestamps 
	placed in the domain RPT info record.  Setting the clocks used to 
	generate timestamps other than Event Log timestamps is 
	implementation-dependent, and should be documented by the HPI 
	implementation provider.

	Some underlying implementations may not be able to handle the same 
	relative and absolute time ranges, as those defined in HPI.  Such 
	limitations will be documented in implementation-specific documentation.  
	When a time value is set in a region that is not supported by the 
	implementation, an error code of SNMP_GENERROR  will be returned.

	Refer to SaHpiTime for full description."

        DESCRIPTION
        "Sensor Events and Sensor Event States:
        Each Event State may be asserted or deasserted.  The set of Event
	States a sensor may support is defined by the sensor's 
	'Event Category.'  A particular sensor, however, does not have to 
	support all the Event States defined for its event category.  
	The specific Event States that a particular sensor supports are 
	indicated in the 'Events' field in the sensor's RDR. A sensor is 
	not required to support any Event States. If no Event States are 
	supported by a sensor, the 'Events' field will be 0x0000.  A sensor 
	may not support any Event States that are not defined for its event 
	category. Each Event State is independent, although in some event 
	categories the meaning assigned to the Event States will imply that 
	certain Event States will be mutually exclusive.  For example, a 
	sensor that uses the limit(6) event category should only have 
	one of the two Event States, SAHPI_ES_LIMIT_NOT_EXCEEDED or 
	SAHPI_ES_LIMIT_EXCEEDED asserted at any one time. Except where mutual 
	exclusion is implied, however, sensors may have multiple Event States 
	asserted simultaneously. For example, the event category 
	threshold(2) uses six different event states to report the 
	relationship between the value currently measured by the sensor and up 
	to six different 'threshold' values.  Each threshold is independently 
	examined, and each Event State that represents a threshold that has 
	been 'crossed' will be asserted.  Threshold values must be configured 
	so that 'Minor', 'Major' and 'Critical' thresholds are increasingly 
	extreme readings, such that when a 'Major' threshold has been crossed, 
	the corresponding 'Minor' threshold will also have been crossed, and 
	thus both Event States will be asserted. When a sensor Event State is 
	asserted or deasserted, an event may be generated by the resource.  
        The generated event identifies the sensor and the event state 
        being asserted or deasserted.  The HPI implementation may assign event
        severity levels for each event state assertion or deassertion on an 
        individual sensor basis."

        STATUS          current
        DESCRIPTION     "The table of announcements is used to provide
	a common interface to varied mechanisms for announcing conditions.

	Each announcement in an Annunciator's current set contains a severity
	level, details describing the specific condition that is being reported, 
	an Acknowledged flag, a timestamp indicating when the announcement was 
	added to the set, and an EntryId that uniquely identifies the particular 
	status item within the set.

	EntryIds are assigned to announcements as they are added to the set as 
	well as a Timestamp.  After an announcement is deleted from the current 
	set, its EntryId may be reused for a newly added announcement as long 
	as the new announcement will have a different timestamp than any 
	previously deleted announcement using the same EntryId.  Thus, the 
	EntryId and Timestamp together will uniquely identify any announcement, 
	which was ever present in the Annunciator's set.

	The actual meaning of the Acknowledged flag is arbitrary, and the 
	actions taken by the platform when announcements are flagged as 
	'acknowledged' or 'unacknowledged' are implementation-specific.  
	The intended use of the flag is to indicate whether a particular 
	announcement in the current set has been recognized by whomever or 
	whatever is inspecting the LEDs, displays, etc., that are being 
	driven by the Annunciator management instrument.  Thus, when 
	announcements are added to the current set, generally the flag 
	should be set to indicate that the condition is 'unacknowledged'.  
	Later, either as the result of an HPI SNMP Manager function call, or due 
	to some implementation-dependent action (such as pressing an 
	'acknowledge' button on a front-panel display), the flag can be 
	changed to indicate that the announcement is now 'acknowledged.'

	The ability to acknowledge announcements is not controlled 
	by the Annunciator 'mode' setting (Auto, User, or Shared).  
	Any announcement may be acknowledged by the HPI implementation, 
	or via the saHpiAnnunciatorAcknowledge() function call, regardless 
	of the current mode setting for the Annunciator.

	Over time, announcements are added to and deleted from an 
	Annunciator`s current set of announcements. This may be done 
	automatically by the HPI implementation to reflect platform fault 
	conditions, or by the HPI SNMP Manager via the HPI interface.  When 
	announcements are added or deleted automatically by the HPI 
	implementation, it is implementation-specific which announcements 
	are added or removed.

		STATUS		current
		DESCRIPTION
		"This columnar object can be used to write to the text controls. To do so, first 
	set the line number in saHpiCtrlTextLine and then write to this object. 

	The first line of the text control is line number  1 . If less than a full line of 
	data is written, the control will clear all spaces beyond those written on the line. 
	Thus writing a zero-length string will clear the addressed line. It is also possible 
	to include more characters in the text passed in this columnar node than will fit on 
	one line; in this case, the control will wrap to the next line (still clearing the 
	trailing characters on the last line written). Thus, there are two ways to write 
	multiple lines to a text control: 
		
		(a) set saHpiCtrlTextState repeatedly for each line, or 
		(b) set saHpiCtrlTextState once and send more characters than will fit on one line.

	 An HPI SNMP Manager should not assume any  cursor positioning  characters are 
	available to use, but rather should always write full lines and allow  wrapping  to 
	occur. 

	When calling this  object, an HPI SNMP Manager may set the line number to 
	255; in this case, the entire control will be cleared, and the data will be written 
	starting on line 1. (This is different from simply writing at line 1, which only 
	alters the lines written to.) This feature may be used to clear the entire control, 
	which can be accomplished by setting: saHpiCtrlTextLine = 255; saHpiCtrlState = '';

	Note that the number of lines and columns in a text control can be obtained from 
	the saHpiCtrlTextMaxLines and saHpiCtrlTextMaxChars. 

	Note that the saHpiCtrlTextLanguage object has the language setting and 
	saHpiCtrlTextType objecthas the text type.

	Note that the SNMP errors that are returned are mapped to the
	HPI errors that could be returned (errors above the value 6
	are SNMPv2 or v3 protocol and are converted to genErr(1) for v1
	protocol).

          available for use by the managed device;

        - `notInService(2)', which indicates that the conceptual
    	  row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
	  the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
	  no implication regarding the internal consistency of
	  the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
	  the current state of the managed device.

        - `createAndWait(5)', which is supplied by a management
          station wishing to create a new instance of a
          conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
          the managed device). 
	  
	  This function is used to add an Area to the specified 
	  Inventory Data Repository.  The row is created 
	  (and changes state to 'active' when the saHpiAreaType 
	  has been correctly set) to a new instance of the 
	  conceptual row. The dis-allowed saHpiAreaType value is 
	  undefined(0) and unspecified(256).
	  
	  It is the responsibility of the caller to specify an 
	  AreadId that has not been previously assigned.  The 
	  user specifies AreaId may or maynot be the same value
	  as the under lying HPI system management service.  The 
	  HPI assigned ID will be reflected in the columnar node
	  'saHpiAreaIdIndex'.
	  

        - `destroy(6)', which is supplied by a management station
          wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
          an existing conceptual row. This function allows the 
          HPI MIB User to delete an Inventory Data Area, including 
          the Area header and all fields contained with the area, 
          from a particular Inventory Data Repository.
	  In some implementations, certain Areas are intrinsically 
	  read-only.  The saHpiAreaIsReadOnly flag, indicates if the 
          Area is read-only. If the Inventory Data Area is not 
          read-only, but contains a Field that is read-only, the Area 
          cannot be deleted.  An attempt to delete an Area that 
          contains a read-only Field will return an error."

	state, the columnar objects: saHpiFieldType, 
	saHpiFieldTextType, saHpiTextLanguage, and saHpiFieldText

    - `notInService(2)', which indicates that the conceptual
    	row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
	the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
	no implication regarding the internal consistency of
	the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
	the current state of the managed device.

    - `createAndWait(5)', which is supplied by a management
    	station wishing to create a new instance of a

	station is responsible of providing valid values to the
	columnar objects: saHpiFieldIsReadOnly, saHpiFieldType,
	saHpiFieldTextType, saHpiTextLanguage and saHpiFieldText.

        DESCRIPTION     "
	The Annunciator table is used to control the set of annunciators 
	associated with a resource.

	An Annunciator management instrument holds a set of individual
	announcements.  The function of the Annunciator is to communicate 
	the contents of its current set via whatever platform-specific 
	mechanism is associated with that particular Annunciator management 
	instrument.  For example, if announcements are to be communicated 
	via lighting a set of LEDs on a front-panel display, the Annunciator 
	management instrument may analyze its current set of announcements 
	and turn on a single LED reflecting the most severe condition found, 
	or turn on a 'System Ok' LED if there are currently no items in the set.  
	A different Annunciator may continuously scroll each announcement in
	its set on a text display, as well as turning on LEDs and setting 
	dry-contact relays to reflect the severity of conditions present.  
	A third Annunciator may announce items in its set by sending messages 
	to a proprietary management system, or by sending emails or pages to 
	a system technician.

	The Annunciator provides a common interface to these varied mechanisms 
	for announcing conditions, so the HPI SNMP Manager is not burdened by 
	platform-to-platform differences.  However, the current content of any 
	annunciator management instrument is not defined by the HPI standard 
	in the same way that the contents of the DAT are defined.  Thus, the 
	HPI implementation and HPI SNMP Manager's can exert more control over 
	what conditions should be announced.  Further, a platform can contain 
	multiple Annunciator management instruments, each reflecting a different 
	physical announcement device in the platform.  By exposing each separately, 
	HPI SNMP Manager's and the HPI implementation can control which conditions 
	are handled by each announcement device.

	An Annunciator management instrument may be implemented using other HPI 
	controls that are in 'auto' mode; for example, digital controls to turn 
	LEDs on and off, stream controls to sound audible alerts, and/or text 
	controls to display detailed information.  However, Annunciators may 
	also operate directly to report conditions using mechanisms that are 
	not themselves visible directly in the HPI interface.

	Over time, announcements are added to and deleted from an Annunciator`s 
	current set of announcements. This may be done automatically by the HPI 
	implementation to reflect platform fault conditions, or by the HPI SNMP 
	Manager via the HPI interface.  When announcements are added or deleted 
	automatically by the HPI implementation, it is implementation-specific 
	which announcements are added or removed."

	"The Annunciator management instrument has a current mode that 
	indicates whether announcements are added and removed automatically 
	by the HPI implementation, by the HPI SNMP Manager, or both.  The mode may 
	be set to one of three values, with the following meanings: 	 
  	 
	auto(1) - the HPI implementation automatically adds and deletes 
		announcements; the HPI SNMP Manager is not permitted to add or delete announcements. 	 
	user(2) - the HPI SNMP Manager may add and delete announcements; the HPI 
		implementation will not automatically add or delete announcements. 	 
	shared(3) -  the HPI implementation automatically adds and deletes 
		announcements, and the HPI SNMP Manager may also add and delete announcements. 	 
  	 
	The initial mode of each Annunciator is implementation-specific.  The HPI 
	User may change the mode of Annunciators with the saHpiAnnunciatorMode object.  
	However, the mode may be configured to be Read-only, in which case the HPI 
	User will not be able to change the mode. 	 
  	 
	When the mode is user(2) or shared(3), HPI SNMP Managers may add or delete any types 
	of announcements in the Annunciator's current set - not just HPI SNMP Manager announcements.  
	This is allowed so that the HPI SNMP Manager can exert complete control over what conditions 
	are being announced, if that is required.  Note that this is less restrictive than 
	the similar operations on the DAT.  To distinguish between announcements added to 
	an Annunciator automatically and those added by an HPI SNMP Manager, an saHpiAddedByUser 
	field in the announcement indicates the source of the announcement in the set.

	Note: Enumerated values are increased by one value compared to SAI-HPI-B.01.01 spec."
