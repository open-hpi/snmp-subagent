    DESCRIPTION
	"This MIB defines the HPI instrumentation based on
	'Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface'
	(SA-HPI-A.01.01).

	This MIB module defines a set of objects that allow the 
         management of entities on a variety of hardware platforms.  The  
         abstractions presented in this MIB are derived from the 
                  Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface 
                  specification version 01.01.
           
         The MIB views a hardware platform as a collection of physical 
                  entities that can be managed individually.  A logical 
                  collection of entities comprises a management domain.

         Each entity has a common set of attributes reflected in the 
         entity table.  Entities may have additional categorical 
                  attributes that may exist in one or more of the hotswap 
                  table, control table, sensor table, watchdog table,
		  inventory control table and config table.

         The hotswap table defines management attributes
         for an entity that supports hotswap, generally referred to as 
                  a FRU.

         The controls table defines variables for reading and setting 
                  controls associated with an entity.

         The sensors table defines variables for reading sensors 
                  associated with an entity as well as controlling event 
                  generation for that sensor.

	The watchdog table defines variables for reading watchdog
		  associated with an entitry.

	The inventory control defines variables for reading inventory
		resources.  
    
	This MIB is version 1.3.1"

HpiTimeStamp ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    	STATUS       current
    	DESCRIPTION
	"
 An HPI time value represents the local time as the number of nanoseconds
 from 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, in a 64-bit signed integer. This format
 is sufficient to represent times with nano-second resolution from the
 year 1678 to 2262. Every API which deals with time values must define
 the timezone used.

 It should be noted that although nano-second resolution is supported
 in the data type, the actual resolution provided by an implementation
 may be more limited than this.

 The value -263, which is 0x8000000000000000, is used to indicate
 'unknown/unspecified time'.

 Conversion to/from POSIX and other common time representations is
 relatively straightforward. The following code framgment converts
 between SaHpiTimeT and time_t:

     time_t tt1, tt2;
     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

     time(&tt1);
     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tt1  1000000000;
     tt2 = saHpiTime / 1000000000;

The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timeval:

     struct timeval tv1, tv2;
     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

     gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tv1.tv_sec  1000000000 + tv1.tv_usec  1000;
     tv2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
     tv2.tv_usec = saHpiTime % 1000000000 / 1000;

 The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timespec:

     struct timespec ts1, ts2;
     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;

     clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts1);
     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) ts1.tv_sec  1000000000 + ts1.tv_nsec;
     ts2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
     ts2.tv_nsec = saHpiTime % 1000000000;

 Note, however, that since time_t is (effectively) universally 32 bits,
 all of these conversions will cease to work on January 18, 2038.

 Some subsystems may need the flexibility to report either absolute or
 relative (eg. to system boot) times. This will typically be in the
 case of a board which may or may not, depending on the system setup,
 have an idea of absolute time. For example, some boards may have
 'time of day' clocks which start at zero, and never get set to the
 time of day.

 In these cases, times which represent 'current' time (in events, for
 example) can be reported based on the clock value, whether it has been
 set to the actual date/time, or whether it represents the elapsed time
 since boot. If it is the time since boot, the value will be (for 27
 years) less than 0x0C00000000000000, which is Mon May 26 16:58:48 1997.
 If the value is greater than this, then it can be assumed to be an
 absolute time.

 Every API which can report either absolute or relative times must
 state this rule clearly in its interface specification.

                     pulseOn(4),
                     auto(256)
        discrete - Unsigned 32bit integer  (4 octets)

        analog   - octets 1-4 represent the value specified in
		   network byte order.

        stream   - A stream control is represented as follows:
                     octet 1    - repeat flag
                     octets 2-5 - count of octets of data stored in the stream specified 
                                  in network byte order.
                     octets 6-9 - contain the stream data.

        text     - Text control attributes are represented as follows:
                     octet 1    - Line number (255 indicates all lines).
				When reading:
				Note that depending on the data type and 
				language, the text may be encoded in 2-byte 
				Unicode, which requires two bytes of data per
				character.

				When writting:
				If less than a full line of data is written, 
				the control will clear all spaces beyond 
				those written on the line. Thus writing a
				zero-length string will clear the addressed line. 
				It is also possible to include more characters 
				in the text passed in the CtrlState structure 
				than will fit on one line; in this case, 
				the control will 'wrap' to the next line 
				(still clearing the trailing characters on the
				last line written).

		The data will be in saHpiCtrlTextType, 
		saHpiCtrlTextLanguage, and saHpiCtrlText.


        oem      - An oem control is represented as follows:
                     octets 1-4   - manufacturer ID in network byte order

		The oem text data is located in saHpiCtrlText.
		The saHpiCtrlTextType and saHpiCtrlTextLanguage are both
		set to undefined (0).

The value will contain the line of text (the line

This value will consist of the text of all the lines concatenated,

Note that depending on the data type and language, the text may be
encoded in 2-byte Unicode, which requires two bytes of data per

Note that the number of lines and columns in a text control
can be obtained from the saHpiCtrlAttributes.

When writing, if less than a full line of data is written, 
the control will clear all spaces beyond those written on the line. 
Thus writing a zero-length string will clear the addressed line. 
It is also possible to include more characters in the text passed
