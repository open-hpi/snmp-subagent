This is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's 
Hardware Platform Interface SNMP sub-agent.

Through this subagent one can includes support for multiple different 
types of hardware including: IPMI, IBM Blade Center (via SNMP), 
Linux Watchdog devices, and Sysfs based systems.

---------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------
The following software is required to build openhpi

any HPI 1.0 implementation that is based on SAF specification 
	SAI-HPI-A.01.01. Recommended: openhpi >= 0.4
autoconf >= 2.50
automake >= 1.5
net-snmp >= 5.0.8
	(Don't use earlier versions - the AgentX protocol had some
	 serious issues).
	(Don't use 5.0.7 - it has a bug in the CONTAINER operations that 
	 seg faults the sub-agent).
GLIB-1.2	(note we may be switching to 2.0 in the next release)

---------------------------------------------------------
BUILD / INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------
First time to extract the code:
run ./boostrap

This will generate all files needed to compile.

after running the bootstrap script, run:
	./configure

then make (or make rpm)
and then (as root or with proper system install permissions)
	make install (or install from the rpm).

It will generate the subagent code and put the configuration file 
- hpiSubagent.conf in the NetSNMP configuration directory.

---------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING
---------------------------------------------------------

0. Configure your OpenHPI installation to work. Make sure that /etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
   lists the correct plugin.
1. Start the NetSNMP daemon.
2. Start the hpiSubagent. (either use the runtime script: /etc/init.d/openhpi-subagent,
   or just run it from the terminal).  You should see something similar in the
   syslog log file - /var/log/messages:

   ...
   Feb  6 10:53:37 konrad hpiSubagent[9890]: Not sending events during startup.
   Feb  6 10:53:37 konrad hpiSubagent[9890]: Checking HPI infrastructure every 4 seconds.
   Feb  6 10:53:37 konrad hpiSubagent[9890]: Max Event rows 1024.
   ...

3. Browse the MIB tree. When browsing the MIB tree, make sure you 
   load the MIB with your favorite SNMP browser. If you are using 
   NetSNMP commands, set the MIBS environment variable to ALL:

   $export MIBS=ALL

   Then you should have no trouble browsing the HPI MIB:

   $snmpwalk -v2c -c public localhost hpi
   HPI-MIB::saHpiEntryCount.0 = Counter32: 3
   HPI-MIB::saHpiEntryUpdateCount.0 = Gauge32: 3
   HPI-MIB::saHpiEntryUpdateTimestamp.0 = Counter64: 1076082821603968000
   HPI-MIB::saHpiDomainID.0.1.1 = Gauge32: 0
   HPI-MIB::saHpiDomainID.0.2.2 = Gauge32: 0
   HPI-MIB::saHpiDomainID.0.3.3 = Gauge32: 0
   HPI-MIB::saHpiEntryID.0.1.1 = Gauge32: 1
   HPI-MIB::saHpiEntryID.0.2.2 = Gauge32: 2
   HPI-MIB::saHpiEntryID.0.3.3 = Gauge32: 3
   HPI-MIB::saHpiResourceID.0.1.1 = Gauge32: 1
   HPI-MIB::saHpiResourceID.0.2.2 = Gauge32: 2
   HPI-MIB::saHpiResourceID.0.3.3 = Gauge32: 3
   HPI-MIB::saHpiResourceEntityPath.0.1.1 = STRING: "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}{SYSTEM_BOARD,1}"
   HPI-MIB::saHpiResourceEntityPath.0.2.2 = STRING: "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}{POWER_SUPPLY,1}"
   ....

4). If you want to receive traps make sure you are running a SNMP trap daemon
    (NetSNMP provides one - snmptrapd). Furthermore make sure that the SNMP daemon is
    configured to send traps and specify its destination (man snmpd.conf).


---------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
---------------------------------------------------------
To remove the temporary build files, type:

make clean

If you are a maintainer, and need to remove all autogenerated files, type:

make clean
make maintainer-clean

GENERAL RELEASE NOTES and WHAT'S NEW
---------------------------------------------------------

* Second release of the HPI SNMP sub-agent. 

* Support for full implementation of the HPI-MIB v1.4
  (included). This means HPI 1.0 instrumentation using 
  HPI-MIB objects in twenty-three tables:
	- Resource Presence Table entities,
		- HotSwap capabilities,
	- Resource Data Records,
		- Sensors
		    - Current sensor reading,
		    - Reading values for 
			 - Max,
			 - Min, 
			 - Nominal, 
			 - Normal maximum, 
			 - Normal minimum
		    - Threshold values for:
			- Upper Critical,
			- Upper Major,
			- Upper Minor,
			- Lower Critical,
			- Lower Major,
			- Lower Minor,
			- Positive Hysteresis,
			- Negativie Hysteresis	
		- Inventory,
		- Control,
		- Watchdog
	- Events and System Event Log

* Support for notifications/TRAPS as defined in the MIB:
	- For Events:
		- Sensor,
		- Hot Swap,
		- Watchdog,
		- OEM,
		- User
	- For Resource Data Records,
	- For Resource Presence Table

* Support for user configurable options:
	 - update timer for new RPT/RDR/Events ,
	 - maximum events held in eventw row before they are
	   automatically removed,
	 - sending of new found RPT/RDR/Events during startup.

* Example code for retrieving instrumentation information
  using SNMP.
