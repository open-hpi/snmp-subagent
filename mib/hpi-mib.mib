    DESCRIPTION
	"This MIB defines the HPI instrumentation based on
	'Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface'
	(SA-HPI-A.01.01).

	This MIB module defines a set of objects that allow the 
         management of entities on a variety of hardware platforms.  The  
         abstractions presented in this MIB are derived from the 
                  Service Availability Forum Hardware Platform Interface 
                  specification version 01.01.
           
         The MIB views a hardware platform as a collection of physical 
                  entities that can be managed individually.  A logical 
                  collection of entities comprises a management domain.

         Each entity has a common set of attributes reflected in the 
         entity table.  Entities may have additional categorical 
                  attributes that may exist in one or more of the hotswap 
                  table, control table, sensor table, watchdog table,
		  inventory control table and config table.

         The hotswap table defines management attributes
         for an entity that supports hotswap, generally referred to as 
                  a FRU.

         The controls table defines variables for reading and setting 
                  controls associated with an entity.

         The sensors table defines variables for reading sensors 
                  associated with an entity as well as controlling event 
                  generation for that sensor.

	The watchdog table defines variables for reading watchdog
		  associated with an entitry.

	The inventory control defines variables for reading inventory
		resources.  

	This is version 1.3 of this MIB"

	time of the update cannot be determined.

	Otherwise, If the value is less than or equal to 
	SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, then it is relative; 
	if it is greater than SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, then it is absolute.

	Unspecified or unknown time  is:

	Resource Capabilities
			
	This definition defines the capabilities of a given resource. 
	One resource may support any number of capabilities using 
	the bit mask. Every resource must set at least one of 
	these capabilities; ie. zero is not a valid value for a 
	resource's capabilities.

	SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS	  (0x00008000)
	Indicates that all sensors on the resource have the property 
	that their Assertion and Deassertion event enable flags are 
	the same. That is, for all event states whose assertion 
	triggers an event, it is guaranteed that the deassertion of 
	that event will also trigger an event. Thus, the user may 
	track the state of sensors on the resource by monitoring 
	events rather than polling for state changes.

	resource supports managed hotswap.

                        activeHealthy and activeUnhealthy as fault conditions                  
                        are asserted or cleared on the FRU.

         activeUnHealthy: Indicates the entity is now an active 
                          member of the domain.  After a FRU completes the 
                          hardware connection process, the associated entity 
                          enters the activeUnhealthy state if there are faults 
                          present.  An entity will transition between 
                          activeHealthy and activeUnhealthy as fault conditions 
                          are asserted or cleared on the FRU.

         extrationPending: Indicates that the entity has requested extraction of 
                           the associated FRU.  Typically an entity enters this 
                           state when an ejector latch is opened or when a hot 
                           swap button is pressed.

         insertionPending: Indicates entity is transitioning from notPresent or 
                           inactive to an active state as a result of being 
                           physically inserted into the system.

         notPresent: The entity is not present in the system."

	to use.

        digital  - The first octet will indicate its setting to be
                     off(0)
                     on(1),
                     pulseOff(2),

                     auto(255)
        discrete - Unsigned 32bit integer  (4 octets)

        analog   - octets 1-4 represent the value specified in
		   network byte order.

        stream   - A stream control is represented as follows:
                     octet 1    - repeat flag
                     octets 2-5 - count of octets of data stored in the stream specified 
                                  in network byte order.
                     octets 6-9 - contain the stream data.

        text     - Text control attributes are represented as follows:
                     octet 1    - Line number (255 indicates all lines).
				When reading:
				Note that depending on the data type and 
				language, the text may be encoded in 2-byte 
				Unicode, which requires two bytes of data per
				character.

				When writting:
				If less than a full line of data is written, 
				the control will clear all spaces beyond 
				those written on the line. Thus writing a
				zero-length string will clear the addressed line. 
				It is also possible to include more characters 
				in the text passed in the CtrlState structure 
				than will fit on one line; in this case, 
				the control will 'wrap' to the next line 
				(still clearing the trailing characters on the
				last line written).
                     octet 2    - Language. The value can be: 
				Undef (0), Afar (1), Abkhazian (2), Afrikaans (3),
				Amharic (4), Arabic (5), Assamese (6), Aymara (7),
				Azerbaijani (8), Bashkir (9), Byelorussian (10),

	Each sensor may support one or more of raw, interpreted, or event status 
	representations of the sensor data. For analog sensors the raw value is the 
	raw value from the sensor (such as ticks per fan blade) and the interpreted 
	value is the raw value converted in to a usable format (such as RPM). The 
	interpreted value can be calculated by the HPI implementation using the 
	sensor factors or by another OEM means.
	
	The five octets represent bit-flags of the maximum, minimum, nominal,
	normalmax, and normal min. Each of the octets is the flag for the type
	of sensor information is present.

	The five octets are:


	1	- maximum value sensor data is represented as		
			 RAW         0x01
			 INTERPRETED 0x02 
			 EVENT_STATE 0x04

	2	- minimum value sensor data is represented as		
			 RAW         0x01

			 EVENT_STATE 0x04
	3	- nominal value sensor data is represented as
