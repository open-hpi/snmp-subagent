 - Figure out if the saHpiAutoInsertTimeoutGet/Set and saHpiAutoExtractionTimeoutGet/Set return value (SaHpTimeT) is fully SahpiTimeT complaint (division by a billion). 
 - The Event row might be shortnened? Perhaps have the OID to the resource, and some of the information?
 - Perhaps write a struct for the saHpiDomainID, saHpiResourceIdT, oids, and such to pass that instead of individual entries?
 - Add another argument for 'getSaHpiSession' - domain_id. 
 - Do all of those IBM-KR comments left behind and make sure they are (not)valid.
